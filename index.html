                    <h2>Scribbles</h2>
                    <div id="scribbles" class="text-container">Six second scribbles is a great card game which you
                        should get to play
                        with your family and friends.
                        Unfortunately, my friends are living abroad this year, so I decided to make a web version of the
                        game so we could play together.
                        I used the python Flask library for this, as I was familiar with it from more than one past
                        project. I used the flask-socketio library
                        to handle the websockets, which I had not used before. I used the javascript library socket.io
                        to handle the websockets on the client side.
                        I used bootstrap to make the website look nice. I wanted the server to be able to handle
                        multiple games at once, so I implemented a lobby system.
                        One player would create a lobby, and then other players could join via a code. The players could
                        then vote to start the game, which was communicated via websockets.
                        There were many cards to type up from the card game, so I made a little website interface to
                        type up the cards, which would then be saved to a file.
                        In a game, players would make a drawing, which would be sent to the server, and then sent to the
                        other players. The other players would then have to guess what the drawing was.
                        I stored the images using a custom class I made which implemented pickling, and cleaned up the
                        images after a certain time, and when a new round started.
                        I deployed this project to azure, but it is no longer on there, as my student account expired. I
                        have a private deployment I can use with friends, but I won't link here.

                    <h2>Chess</h2>
                    <div id="chess" class="text-container">
                        I have been using C++ for a little while now, but I wanted to make a project that would test my
                        knowledge, and hopefully provide
                        some learning experiences. I also wanted to make a game on a lower level than I had before, so I
                        decided to make a chess game.
                        I had used the QT library before for a university project, but I wanted to work at a lower
                        level, so I decided to use the SDL2 library.
                        I used the SDL2 library to create a window, and to handle input. I used the SDL2_image library
                        to load images for the chess pieces.
                        I implemented the game logic using some OO principles. It was in my mind while I was making it
                        that I would want to make a chess AI at some point,
                        so I made sure to keep the game logic, input handling, and rendering separate. I also had a way
                        to store game states, so I could look ahead easily.
                        Memory had to be dynamically allocated for the game states, so I used smart pointers to make
                        sure that memory was freed when it was no longer needed.
                        I have done several C projects, especially at university, so I was very familiar with using raw
                        pointers to manage memory, but I wanted to use smart pointers
                        to practice using them. I also implemented a feature to save and load from a file in the
                        Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN) format, which is a standard format
                        for chess states. I used this feature to test the game logic. I found that there was no need to
                        implement checkmate, as the game logic I had implemented
                        already handled it, as player where unable to make moves that would put them in checkmate, so
                        when checkmate happened, a player would be unable to make a move.
                        I implemented a feature to highlight the squares that a piece could move to, which was very
                        useful for testing the game logic. In the future, I will make a chess AI
                        using the minimax algorithm, and I will use the game logic I have already implemented.

                    <h2>We suck at deliveries</h2>
                    <div id="delv" class="text-container">I competed in Ludum Dare 53, my first game jam. The theme was
                        delivery,
                        and there was a game I
                        had wanted to make for a while which could be made as a delivery game. It was inspired by the
                        car in the level select
                        menu in the overcooked games, and came out very nicely. I made the game with one other person,
                        and I contributed a lot of the gameplay code for this project, as well as
                        some of the 3D art. I modeled the van and the pallets in Blender. I programmed a lightweight
                        custom physics engine that allowed us
                        to calculate collisions our van took with the environment without dealing with Unity's built-in
                        physics engine. I also programmed the
                        package distribution system. This involved keeping track of "collectors" and "spawners", where
                        the collectors are houses the player
                        must deliver packages to, and the spawners are the shops where the packages spawn in. For each
                        package spawned, there must be a house which expects
                        a package. Additionally, we had to keep track of packages that hadn't been delivered in a
                        certain amount of time, so we could call the player out.
                        All of the magic numbers involved here were put onto nice easily adjustable public variables, so
                        we could easily tweak the gameplay, and speed up
                        gameplay for what little testing we had time for.

                    <div id="flash" class="text-container">I took part in the great uni hack in late 2022. This
                        was a great experience, where we created a full stack application in 24 hours.
                        I worked with two other people, and we created a flashcard application, which would generate
                        flashcards from your notes.
                        About 8 months later, Quizlet released a feature which did exactly this, and we are looking to
                        release a full version of our application soon.
                        We used the python library flask for the backend, and wrote the frontend using node.js. This was
                        before ChatGPT came out, so we used
                        an LLM called Cohere to generate the flashcards. I worked on the backend, and implemented some
                        of the database functionality, as well as
                        some of the endpoints. I also worked with the LLM, and implemented some of the code to generate
                        the flashcards.
                        I am still currently working on this project, and we have changed some of our infrastructure,
                        such as moving to nosql from SQLite, and
                        movin to use chatgpt. My work currently has been on improving response times on the backend, and
                        researching
                        implementing a subscription system.

                    <div id="grass" class="text-container">For this project I wanted to make grass similar to how grass
                        works in some
                        AAA games,
                        using real geometry for
                        each blade.
                        There are two stages to the grass generation. The first stage is in a compute shader which
                        calculates a
                        location and rotation for each blade.
                        Then a stage in the surface shader calculates sway, lighting, colour, and if the blade is
                        flattened by an
                        object.
                        The final result is optimized enough that it runs at over 100 fps with 500000 visible blades,
                        which I am
                        very happy with.

                    <div> Following the procedural animation project, I decided to create my own FABRIK implementation
                        for
                        unity, having initially used another implementation.
                        I then tested the FABRIK implementation with a simple procedurally animated cat.

                    <h2>Procedural Animation</h2>
                    <div id="anim" class="text-container"> To further my interest in procedural animation I decided to
                        design a
                        project which
                        would develop the skillset. This took the form of a procedurally animated
                        "tentacle monster" which can move around with convincing animation. I calculate new feet
                        positions randomly
                        in the direction of velocity so
                        that a minimum number of tentacles are always in spawn. When feet reach a certain distance from
                        the centre,
                        they despawn, leading to new ones spawing.
                        In order to have the tentacles convincingly spawn and despawn, I made a script to shrink the
                        mesh. This is
                        in the form of a compute shader which
                        clips the mesh down to the required size. By the end of my project I had produced a
                        monster-character with
                        convincing animation that can be player controlled.
